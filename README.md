# Developer Test for Destinations NSW

## Environment Setup

When running locally you will need to setup a .env file to configure your local environment.
Copy the _example_.env file to .env and add your api key to the api_key line

Then cd to the web/ directory and run something like:

source ../.env && php -S localhost:8888 index.php

## Issues

* Documentation! (sorry)
* Should have used a front end framework
* Load more button shows before list has rendered
* Use more of data from the API, currently just using productName and productDescription
* Test
